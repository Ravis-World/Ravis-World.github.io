            If you're reading this, you're almost out of time. The reason you're here, in the files, is because you have to destroy the trojan, once and for all. But you have to do it in secret, because we don't want to alert the guards.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will face several challenges, and to successfully kill the trojan, you have to have â‚±1,000,000 to open the vault.

            If you forget, I will send it to you again, but here are the login details:<br>

            Also, your heart won't start beating, because you won't be "Awake", so that's a plus, almost like another lifeline, hence the "And Many More".
        </p>
        <p>
            I will be updating you from time to time. Good Luck.
